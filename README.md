# TriviaGame

This is a Simpsons trivia game that tests your knowledge of the Simpsons with 10 questions. You get the questions right and you get a reward. You get the questions wrong and you lose a life and get a thumbs down. How much do you know the simpsons? 

Let's see [Simpsons Trivia](https://eotoalex.github.io/Simpsons_Trivia/).

# Working on the Simpsons Trivia Site
I enjoyed the Simpsons as a kid, so working on this project was a fun way of refreshing my knowledge of Javascript and JQuery, while also working with gifs and images that would represent a give character's role in the series when a correct response is given. The thumbs down gif was a result of watching Gladiator that week, but I could have just as easily put in a Mr. Burns gif where he releases the hounds. Have fun playing, and let me know if you'd like to see more Simpsons trivia, or maybe Futurama.
